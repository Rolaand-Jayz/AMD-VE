# AMD Video Enhancer

> **Linux-first · AMD-first · Experimental beta**

AMD-VE is a native C++ video-enhancement application for AMD GPUs. It combines ROCm, MiGraphX, HIP, Vulkan, and FFmpeg to restore, clean, and upscale video through an AMD-oriented inference and media pipeline.

## Why it matters

This project is both an application and a systems-integration case study. When the application exposed performance and integration limits in the underlying inference stack, I investigated MiGraphX itself, implemented GPU-side optimizations, measured them under stated conditions, submitted the work upstream, and integrated a customized MiGraphX toolchain into the application.

The work was AI-assisted, but the engineering responsibility remained human: define the problem, inspect the stack, test hypotheses, benchmark changes, preserve limitations, and verify the result.

## Verified scope

- Public beta: `v0.1.0-beta.1`
- Primary verified system: Arch Linux, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, Radeon RX 7900 GRE
- Primary verified path: MiGraphX inference with FFmpeg media processing
- Other backends and package targets are documented by support tier; packaging reach is not proof of universal compatibility
- Experimental software: not presented as production-ready

## MiGraphX optimization case study

A wavefront-aware pointwise launch-bound change reduced oversized Wave32 PReLU-heavy launches from a `local=1024`-style geometry to `local=128`. On an OpenProteus FP16 workload on gfx1100, the isolated MiGraphX workload measured approximately **11.80 ms → 8.31 ms total** and **11.90 ms → 8.39 ms mean**, roughly a **30% reduction relative to the preceding optimization-series baseline**. This is a workload-specific result, not a claim that MiGraphX as a whole became 30% faster.

The related upstream work is split across [AMDMIGraphX #4707](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/pull/4707), [#4708](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/pull/4708), [#4709](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/pull/4709), and [#4710](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/pull/4710), all currently open. The earlier umbrella proposal, [#4668](https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/pull/4668), is closed and was not merged. Read the repository's benchmark provenance before generalizing this result.

## Project lineage

AMD-VE established the AMD-first application and lower-level inference-stack work. That led to deeper FSR reverse engineering and eventually Temporal Forge's more formal research and validation process.

AMD Video Enhancer is a Linux-first video enhancer that uses ML and AI models to restore, clean, and upscale footage on AMD GPUs. It is intentionally built around AMD's ROCm, MiGraphX, HIP, and Vulkan stack rather than NVIDIA/CUDA, because the whole point of this project is to give AMD hardware a first-class experience instead of treating it like an afterthought.

## Release snapshot

**Current public state:** `v0.1.0-beta.1` is published on the GitHub Releases page as the first public beta prerelease from `main`.

**Verified primary system:** Arch Linux + Ryzen 7 7800X3D + Radeon RX 7900 GRE.

**Primary verified backend path:** MiGraphX inference with the FFmpeg media pipeline on that reference system.

**Bundled MiGraphX reality:** the current beta prerelease packages bundle a custom MiGraphX runtime/toolchain because the required upstream behavior is not yet available in the stock system path.

**Support boundary:** package targets are broader than verified compatibility. Packaging reach is not the same thing as support proof.

Start with these canonical release-facing docs before assuming more than the repo can currently prove:

- [`docs/SUPPORT_TIERS.md`](docs/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)
- [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md)
- [`docs/VALIDATION_AND_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AND_EVIDENCE.md)
- [`docs/BETA_TESTING_PROGRAM.md`](docs/BETA_TESTING_PROGRAM.md)

## Why this kind of app matters

Old video is usually not “bad” in just one way. It is often blurry, noisy, blocky, over-compressed, poorly scaled, repeatedly re-encoded, damaged by weak capture hardware, or scarred by years of format conversion.

That is why video enhancement tools matter. When they are done well, they can:

- recover detail that low-quality scaling threw away
- reduce visible compression damage
- clean up ringing, blocking, and mosquito noise
- improve damaged or neglected archive footage
- make low-quality source material more usable for editing, research, restoration, and personal preservation
- turn “barely watchable” clips into footage that is genuinely useful again

This repository exists because that value should not belong only to closed tools, only to expensive workflows, or only to one GPU vendor.

## Why the AMD focus is deliberate

A lot of the AI video software landscape has been shaped around NVIDIA-first assumptions. Commercial products like Topaz Video AI can be powerful, but they are expensive for many hobbyists, archivists, tinkerers, and small creators, and the broader tooling ecosystem often aims its fastest path at CUDA, Tensor cores, and NVIDIA-specific stacks first.

The result is familiar: capable AMD hardware ends up pushed onto generic paths, partial support, slower fallbacks, or no serious support at all. AMD users do not consistently get the same polished experience NVIDIA users get, even when the underlying GPUs are more than capable of doing real work.

That gap keeps growing because industry habits keep reinforcing themselves. CUDA launched in 2007, which means it has had nearly twenty years of real-world adoption, documentation, production hardening, tutorials, examples, and mindshare; that long head start taught much of the industry to see GPU compute through an NVIDIA-shaped lens, while AMD's ROCm ecosystem developed with far less public visibility and far fewer end-user application examples.

## Where MiGraphX fits into that story

MiGraphX is AMD's graph compiler and inference runtime layer inside the ROCm stack. In plain English: it sits in the part of the stack that takes a model graph, lowers it into something AMD GPUs can execute efficiently, and gives applications a path to better inference performance than “just run something generic and hope for the best.”

The problem is that MiGraphX is still almost invisible in public end-user applications. Public, consumer-facing examples are rare enough that many developers have never seen what it looks like in a real app, what kind of performance discipline it enables, or how to build supporting systems around it for model preparation, artifact reuse, runtime validation, and shipping.

That lack of public history makes the stack harder to learn, harder to trust, and harder to copy. One of the big reasons this repository matters is that it is a public implementation of a thing very few people ever get to inspect: a real AMD-first video enhancement app that treats MiGraphX as a serious production backend instead of a footnote.

That scarcity also matters for the way people talk about AI. A common dismissal is that AI can only remix patterns from mature, heavily documented ecosystems that already have endless tutorials, examples, and stack-overflowed history behind them. This project pushes against that claim: the MiGraphX side of the stack is sparse enough in public examples that there was no comfortable library of consumer-app patterns to simply copy.

To be careful and honest: this README does **not** claim that nobody anywhere has ever built anything remotely similar in private. What it does say is that, to the best of this project's public view, there was no rich public trail of MiGraphX-powered consumer video-enhancer implementations to follow. The lack of documentation and lack of examples is part of the story, not a footnote.

If you want the blunt version of why that matters beyond this app itself, read [`docs/WHY_THIS_PROJECT_MATTERS.md`](docs/WHY_THIS_PROJECT_MATTERS.md).

## AI-assisted engineering and verification

This project was built with substantial AI assistance, including in an under-documented AMD/ROCm/MiGraphX problem space. That assistance expanded the amount of unfamiliar systems work I could investigate; it did not replace human responsibility for requirements, source inspection, implementation choices, benchmarking, review, and verification.

The work had to operate inside a stack with thin docs, sparse examples, immature edges, packaging problems, runtime-validation problems, and performance questions that did not come with a neat cookbook.

In other words: the AI was not just copying a familiar pattern from a saturated ecosystem. It helped move work forward in an area where the public examples are scarce, the documentation is incomplete, and parts of the surrounding software stack still needed to be pushed, organized, and made more usable. That is an important distinction.

The resulting value is the combination: AI-assisted implementation, independent inspection, measured results, explicit limitations, and iterative remediation.

## What is in the repo today

This repository currently contains:

- a native **C++20** application core
- a **CLI** frontend (`ave`)
- an optional **Qt GUI** frontend (`ave_gui`)
- a deterministic **pipeline planner** for stage ordering
- a **model manager** that downloads, prepares, compiles, validates, and reuses model artifacts
- a **MiGraphX-first** inference path
- a **ROCm/HIP ONNX Runtime** fallback path
- a **Vulkan Compute** fallback path
- an **NCNN Vulkan** fallback path
- an **FFmpeg-based** media pipeline and fallback filter path
- a packaging toolchain for **portable bundles** and **native Linux packages**

If you want the implementation-level version of that story, read [`docs/GOLD_STANDARD_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/GOLD_STANDARD_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md). That document is the technical reality check. This README is the guided front door.

## How the app works at a high level

The short version of the runtime flow is:

1. the user picks stages in the CLI or GUI
2. `PipelinePlanner` puts those stages into a safe deterministic order
3. `VideoProcessor` resolves models, probes runtimes, and selects a backend
4. the backend pre-validates work through `runStage(...)`
5. real frame-by-frame processing happens during `processVideoFile(...)`
6. FFmpeg stays underneath the whole thing as the media spine for probing, frame flow, filters, and final encode

When `--backend auto` is used, the current backend order is:

1. **MiGraphX**
2. **ROCm/HIP (ONNX Runtime)**
3. **Vulkan Compute**
4. **NCNN Vulkan**
5. **FFmpeg fallback**

That order matters because this is not a single-engine toy app. It is a layered video pipeline with multiple real execution paths.

## Prerequisites

### To run packaged builds

You still need the host-side AMD GPU stack that cannot be bundled inside the app archive:

- Linux
- a supported AMD GPU
- working `amdgpu` / KFD device access
- Vulkan driver support on the host
- a functioning ROCm-capable environment for MiGraphX / HIP execution paths

Portable bundles and native packages can ship userspace dependencies, but they cannot ship your kernel driver stack.

### To build from source

The source build expects these core pieces:

- **CMake 3.21+**
- a **C++20 compiler**
- **pkg-config**
- FFmpeg development packages for:
  - `libavcodec`
  - `libavformat`
  - `libavutil`
  - `libavfilter`
  - `libswscale`
- **ROCm / HIP** headers if you want the AMD GPU paths
- **MiGraphX** if you want the primary backend
- **ONNX Runtime** with ROCm support if you want the ROCm/HIP fallback backend
- **Vulkan** loader/SDK support if you want Vulkan-based paths
- **NCNN** if you want the NCNN Vulkan backend
- **Qt 6 Widgets** if you want the GUI target
- **Python 3** for model-bundling and portable/package workflows

### Runtime notes

- release packages bundle app-private `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`
- source builds still expect `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` in `PATH`
- archive-backed model extraction expects `unzip` in `PATH`
- mixed iGPU+dGPU systems may need `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
- unsupported ROCm distributions are still best-effort even if the app itself builds there

## Build from source

Always configure with the major backends enabled:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DAVE_HAVE_CURL=ON \
  -DAVE_HAVE_MIGRAPHX=ON \
  -DAVE_HAVE_HIP=ON \
  -DAVE_HAVE_VULKAN=ON \
  -DAVE_HAVE_NCNN=ON
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Do **not** use a bare `cmake -S . -B build` in this repository. The project is designed around explicit backend selection.

If you need to bundle a custom MiGraphX runtime/toolchain for packaging work, pass it explicitly with `-DAVE_BUNDLED_MIGRAPHX_PREFIX=/path/to/custom/migraphx`. Release-facing packaging should not depend on a hidden maintainer-local home-directory path.

## How to use the app

### Check what the machine can actually run

```bash
./build/ave --list-backends
```

### Preview a job without rendering it

```bash
./build/ave \
  --input input.mp4 \
  --output output.mp4 \
  --stage restore_compression \
  --stage upscale:model=clearreality-x4-fast \
  --dry-run
```

### Run a CLI job

```bash
./build/ave \
  --input input.mp4 \
  --output output.mp4 \
  --stage denoise \
  --stage upscale:model=openproteus-compact-x2
```

### Run the GUI

```bash
./build/ave_gui
```

### What to expect on first use

The first run of a MiGraphX-backed model may trigger model preparation or compilation. Compiled `.mxr` artifacts are cached and reused later when the runtime fingerprint still matches the current environment.

That first-run path can take minutes on the reference stack. The app now emits compile progress while `migraphx-driver` is working, but some preparation phases are still coarser than a perfect progress bar. Treat first-run preparation as deliberate setup work, not as a sign that later runs will always be that slow.

## ROCm and MiGraphX customization

This repository does more than just “use ROCm if it happens to be installed.” It also supports a customized, app-bundled MiGraphX toolchain flow for packaging and portable builds.

Important pieces of that story:

- release tooling expects any custom MiGraphX prefix to be passed explicitly through `AVE_BUNDLED_MIGRAPHX_PREFIX` or `-DAVE_BUNDLED_MIGRAPHX_PREFIX=...`
- packaging can bundle a custom MiGraphX runtime under the app tree
- compile-enabled portable bundles can ship `migraphx-driver` and its side libraries
- helper scripts can stage ABI-matched MiGraphX runtime overlays and compiler-side dependencies from the local package cache
- portable and packaged builds isolate the app runtime from unrelated host libraries as much as possible

## Bottom line

This project is trying to do two things at once: build a useful AMD-first AI video enhancer, and make the path visible enough that other people can learn from it instead of treating the whole ROCm/MiGraphX side of the world like a black box. If you care about restoration, upscaling, AMD GPU compute, open implementation details, or the sheer chaos-energy of a zero-knowledge vibe-coded systems project actually becoming real software, you are in the right repo.
